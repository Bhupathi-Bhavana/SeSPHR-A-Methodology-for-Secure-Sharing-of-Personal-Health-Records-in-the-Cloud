# SeSPHR â€“ A Methodology for Secure Sharing of Personal Health Records in the Cloud

**SeSPHR** is a secure, patient-centric platform for managing and sharing Personal Health Records (PHRs) in cloud environments. It ensures that only authorized users, such as healthcare professionals, family members, and insurance providers, can access sensitive health information, maintaining full data confidentiality and privacy through proxy re-encryption.



##  Project Purpose

The **Secure Sharing of Personal Health Records (SeSPHR)** project is designed to empower individuals to securely manage and share their electronic health records (PHRs) with authorized healthcare providers. It ensures the privacy, confidentiality, and integrity of sensitive health data in cloud environments.

This system facilitates:
- Secure, cloud-based access to personal health data  
- Better coordination between patients and healthcare professionals  
- Enhanced patient control over who can view or access their records  
- Confidential sharing and storage through strong security protocols  



## Project Scope

This project implements a digital platform for secure PHR sharing, supporting:

- **Strong Data Protection**  
  Advanced encryption and authentication to safeguard sensitive medical data from unauthorized access.

- **Role-Based Access Control**  
  Fine-grained access permissions are defined by the PHR owner (patient) to control who sees what.

- **Consent and Permission Management**  
  Patients can manage, grant, or revoke access to their records at any time.

- **Interoperability**  
  Standardized protocols and structured interfaces enable smooth data exchange between healthcare systems and providers.

- **Regulatory Compliance**  
  The system is designed with privacy principles in mind, aligning with healthcare data protection standards for the ethical and legal handling of records.

The platform focuses on both usability and security to support real-world healthcare collaboration while preserving individual privacy rights.
